⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️

This organisation contains only a mirror of the `QED.jl` library. Here, the most recent stable and development versions of the packages in `QED.jl` will be stored.

The actual development of `QED.jl` is done at the [Helmholtz codebase](https://gitlab.hzdr.de/QEDjl). Notice, currently not all developed packages are made public, but will be soon.
