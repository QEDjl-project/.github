# QED.jl: A strong-field particle physics ecosystem

Welcome to the QEDjl-project, where we develop `QED.jl`, a framework to perform
computations and simulations in strong-field QED and beyond. 


⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️

The `QED.jl` ecosystem is currently under construction, which means the packages
in this organization, might and will change rapidly in time. However, semantic
versioning is applied to indicate breaking changes.
