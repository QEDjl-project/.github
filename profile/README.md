# QuantumElectrodynamics.jl: A strong-field particle physics ecosystem

Welcome to the QEDjl-project, where we develop `QuantumElectrodynamics.jl`, a framework to perform
computations and simulations in strong-field QED and beyond. 


⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️

The `QuantumElectrodynamics.jl` ecosystem is currently under construction,
which means the packages in this organization might and will change rapidly
in time. However, semantic versioning is applied to indicate breaking changes.
